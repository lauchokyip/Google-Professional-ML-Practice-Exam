01. You need to build an object detection model for a small startup company to identify if and where the company’s logo appears in an image. You were given a large repository of images, some with logos and some without.
These images are not yet labelled. You need to label these pictures, and then train and deploy the model. What should you do?
a) Create two folders: one where the logo appears and one where it doesn’t. Manually place images in each folder. Use AI Platform to build and train a real time object detection model.
b) Use Vision API to detect and identify logos in pictures and use it as a label. Use AI Platform to build and train a convolutional neural network.
c) Create two folders: one where the logo appears and one where it doesn’t. Manually place images in each folder. Use AI Platform to build and train a convolutional neural network.
d) Use Google Cloud’s Data Labelling Service to label your data. Use AutoML Object Detection to train and deploy the model.

ANS: 

02. You work for a gaming company that develops and manages a popular massively multiplayer online (MMO) game.
The game’s environment is open-ended, and a large number of positions and moves can be taken by a player. Your team has developed an ML model with TensorFlow that predicts the next move of each player.
Edge deployment is not possible, but low-latency serving is required. How should you configure the deployment?
a) Use a Cloud TPU to optimize model training speed.
b) Use AI Platform Prediction with a NVIDIA GPU to make real-time predictions.
c) Use AI Platform Prediction with a high-CPU machine type to get a batch prediction for the players.
d) Use AI Platform Prediction with a high-memory machine type to get a batch prediction for the players.
